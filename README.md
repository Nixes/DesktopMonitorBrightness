# DesktopMonitorBrightness
A utility to allow laptop like monitor brightness control on a desktop. 

Features:
  - Manual Brightness control from slider opened by clicking on system tray.
  - Automatic brightness based on configured sunrise and sunset times.


Uses wxWidgets for the interface, and json for config loading / saving.
Currently only has a windows backend for setting monitor brightness, but a linux one is planned.
